"""
Distribution Comparison - Uniform vs. Gaussian

This script creates a side-by-side comparison showing the visual difference
between uniform random distribution and Gaussian (normal) distribution
for placing stars. This helps learners understand when to use each approach.

Framework: Framework 1 (Hands-On Discovery)
Cognitive Load: Medium (comparing two approaches)
RQ Contributions: RQ1 (framework design), RQ5 (transfer learning)
