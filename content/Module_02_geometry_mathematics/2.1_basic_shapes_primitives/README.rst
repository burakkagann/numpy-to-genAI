2.1 Basic Shapes Primitives
===========================

Foundation of computational geometry through fundamental shapes and drawing algorithms.

This section covers the essential building blocks of generative art - lines, circles, triangles, and other primitive shapes. These exercises establish the mathematical and programming foundations needed for more complex geometric compositions.
