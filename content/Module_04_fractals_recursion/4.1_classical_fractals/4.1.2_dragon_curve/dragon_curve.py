Exercise 4.1.2: Dragon Curve

Generate the Heighway dragon curve fractal using a recursive L/R sequence
and turtle graphics rendering. The dragon curve is created by repeatedly
folding a strip of paper and unfolding at 90-degree angles.

This script demonstrates:
- Recursive sequence generation (L = left turn, R = right turn)
- Turtle graphics interpretation for drawing
- Self-similar fractal patterns
