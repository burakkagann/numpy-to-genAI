    """
    Recursively draw a fractal tree branch.

    Parameters:
        draw: PIL ImageDraw object for drawing lines
        x, y: Starting coordinates of this branch
        length: Length of this branch in pixels
        angle: Direction of growth in radians (0 = straight up)
        depth: Remaining recursion depth (stop when 0)
        branch_angle: Angle offset for child branches (radians)
        length_ratio: How much smaller child branches are (0.0 to 1.0)

    TODO: Implement this function following these steps:
    1. Check the base case: if depth is 0, return immediately
    2. Calculate the endpoint using trigonometry:
       - end_x = x + length * sin(angle)
       - end_y = y - length * cos(angle)  (subtract because y increases downward)
    3. Draw a line from (x, y) to (end_x, end_y)
    4. Calculate the new length for child branches
    5. Recursively call draw_branch for the left branch (angle - branch_angle)
    6. Recursively call draw_branch for the right branch (angle + branch_angle)
