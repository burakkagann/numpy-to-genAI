Overview
========

In this module, you'll discover that digital images are simply arrays of numbers. Understanding this fundamental concept unlocks the door to AI driven generative art. We'll focus on RGB color representation and how to create and manipulate images using NumPy arrays.

**Learning Objectives**

By completing this module, you will:

* Understand images as 3D NumPy arrays with RGB channels
* Create simple colored images from scratch
* Manipulate RGB values to achieve desired colors
* Grasp the additive color model and why computers use RGB

Quick Start: Your First Colorful Image
========================================

Let's start with something visual. Run this code to create a simple image:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Create a two-color image in seconds
   :linenos:
   
   import numpy as np
   from PIL import Image
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   # Create a 200x200 image with 3 color channels (RGB)
   image = np.zeros((200, 200, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
   
   # Top half: cyan (green + blue light)
   image[:100, :, 1] = 255  # Green channel
   image[:100, :, 2] = 255  # Blue channel
   
   # Bottom half: magenta (red + blue light)
   image[100:, :, 0] = 255  # Red channel
   image[100:, :, 2] = 255  # Blue channel
   
   # Display it
   plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
   plt.imshow(image)
   plt.axis('off')
   plt.title('Cyan and Magenta')
   plt.show()

.. tip::
   
   Notice the shape `(200, 200, 3)`, respectively they are defined as  **(height, width, channels)**. The third dimension holds our red, green, and blue values.

Understanding Digital Images
==============================

The fundamental insight
------------------------

**An image is just a 3D array of numbers.** Each number represents the intensity of light for one color channel at one pixel location. In Python using NumPy, an RGB image has shape `(height, width, 3)`, where the three channels represent red, green, and blue intensities. 

.. code-block:: python

   # A simple RGB image structure
   image = np.zeros((100, 150, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
   # Shape: (height=100, width=150, channels=3)
   
   # Access a specific pixel's RGB values
   pixel = image[50, 75, :]  # Returns [R, G, B]
   
   # Access just the red channel
   red_channel = image[:, :, 0]

.. important::
   
   Array indexing uses `image[y, x, channel]`. Did you notice **y comes first** (row), then x (column)? This follows matrix notation, where the origin (0, 0) is at the **top-left corner**. 

.. admonition:: Did You Know? ðŸŒˆ
   
   Your display screen doesn't actually show "any color" per pixel! Each pixel contains three tiny subpixels, one red, one green, one blue arranged side by side. They're so small your eye blends them into a single perceived color. If you can, try viewing your screen through a magnifying glass to see the RGB stripe pattern!

The RGB color model
--------------------

RGB is an **additive color model**, meaning we start with darkness (black) and add colored light: 

* **Red (255, 0, 0)** â€” Pure red light
* **Green (0, 255, 0)** â€” Pure green light  
* **Blue (0, 0, 255)** â€” Pure blue light
* **White (255, 255, 255)** â€” All three at maximum
* **Black (0, 0, 0)** â€” No light

Each channel stores values from **0 to 255** (8 bits = 256 possible values), giving us **16,777,216 total colors** (256Â³).  This is called "24-bit true color"  and closely matches the approximately 10 million colors the human eye can discriminate.

   RGB additive color mixing: overlapping light creates secondary colors (Adapted from Woo, 2024)

.. note::
   
   RGB is fundamentally different from mixing paint! Paint uses **subtractive color** (CMYK). You start with white paper and pigments *subtract* wavelengths by absorbing them.  That's why mixing red and green **light** creates yellow, but mixing red and green **paint** creates brown.

Common RGB color patterns
--------------------------

Understanding these patterns helps you think in RGB:

* **Primary colors**: One channel at 255, others at 0
* **Secondary colors**: Two channels at 255, one at 0
  - Cyan `(0, 255, 255)` = Green + Blue 
  - Magenta `(255, 0, 255)` = Red + Blue   
  - Yellow `(255, 255, 0)` = Red + Green 
* **Grayscale**: All three channels equal `(N, N, N)`
* **Pastels**: High values across all channels (light colors)
* **Dark colors**: Low values across all channels

.. admonition:: Did You Know? ðŸ§ 
   
   The human eye has three types of cone cells for color vision, but they're NOT actually "red," "green," and "blue" receptors! The L-cones peak around 570nm (greenish-yellow), M-cones around 540nm (green), and S-cones around 440nm (blue-violet).  RGB is a computational convenience that *approximately* matches this trichromatic vision system (Gonzalez & Woods, 2007; Hunt, 2004).

Hands-On Exercises
==================

Now apply what you've learned with three progressively challenging exercises.  Each builds on the previous one using the **Execute â†’ Modify â†’ Create** approach. 

Exercise 1: Execute and explore
---------------------------------

**Time estimate:** 3-4 minutes

Run the following code and observe the output. Try to predict what color you'll see before running it.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Exercise 1 â€” Solid color image
   :linenos:
   
   import numpy as np
   from PIL import Image
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   # Create a 150x150 image
   image = np.zeros((150, 150, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
   
   # Set all pixels to the same color
   image[:, :, 0] = 255  # Red channel
   image[:, :, 1] = 128  # Green channel  
   image[:, :, 2] = 0    # Blue channel
   
   # Display
   plt.imshow(image)
   plt.axis('off')
   plt.title('What color is this?')
   plt.show()

**Reflection questions:**

* What color appears? Why?
* What would happen if you set all three channels to 255?
* What would `(0, 0, 0)` look like?

.. dropdown:: ðŸ’¡ Solution & Explanation
   
   **Answer:** Orange (or orange-red)
   
   **Why:** Red at maximum (255), green at half intensity (128), and blue absent (0) creates an orange hue. The color `(255, 128, 0)` sits between pure red `(255, 0, 0)` and yellow `(255, 255, 0)`. 
   
   * Setting all channels to 255 â†’ **White** (all light)
   * Setting all channels to 0 â†’ **Black** (no light)

Exercise 2: Modify to achieve goals
-------------------------------------

**Time estimate:** 3-4 minutes

Modify the code from Exercise 1 to create each of these colors. Change only the three channel values.

**Goals:**

1. Create pure cyan (hint: which two colors of light make cyan?)
2. Create a medium gray
3. Create a dark purple

.. dropdown:: ðŸ’¡ Solutions
   
   **1. Pure cyan:**
   
   .. code-block:: python
      
      image[:, :, 0] = 0    # Red: off
      image[:, :, 1] = 255  # Green: full
      image[:, :, 2] = 255  # Blue: full
      # Result: (0, 255, 255)
   
   Cyan is a **secondary color** formed by combining green and blue light.
   
   **2. Medium gray:**
   
   .. code-block:: python
      
      image[:, :, 0] = 128
      image[:, :, 1] = 128
      image[:, :, 2] = 128
      # Result: (128, 128, 128)
   
   Grayscale occurs when **all three channels are equal**. The value determines brightness.
   
   **3. Dark purple:**
   
   .. code-block:: python
      
      image[:, :, 0] = 64   # Red: low
      image[:, :, 1] = 0    # Green: off
      image[:, :, 2] = 96   # Blue: medium-low
      # Result: (64, 0, 96) or similar
   
   Purple combines red and blue. Keep values low for a dark shade. Try `(80, 0, 120)` for a slightly brighter purple.

Exercise 3: Create a gradient pattern
---------------------------------------

**Time estimate:** 5-6 minutes

Now create something from scratch: a horizontal color gradient that transitions smoothly from one color to another.

**Goal:** Create a 200Ã—200 image that transitions from pure red on the left to pure blue on the right.

**Hints:**

* Use a `for` loop to iterate over columns
* The red channel should decrease from left to right
* The blue channel should increase from left to right
* Calculate values proportionally: `value = column * 255 // width`

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Exercise 3 starter code
   
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   # Create image
   height, width = 200, 200
   image = np.zeros((height, width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
   
   # Your code here: fill the image with a gradient
   # Loop over columns and set red and blue channels
   
   # Display
   plt.imshow(image)
   plt.axis('off')
   plt.title('Red to Blue Gradient')
   plt.show()

.. dropdown:: ðŸ’¡ Complete Solution
   
   .. code-block:: python
      :caption: Red-to-blue horizontal gradient
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 10-12
      
      import numpy as np
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      
      # Create image
      height, width = 200, 200
      image = np.zeros((height, width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
      
      # Create gradient from red (left) to blue (right)
      for col in range(width):
          image[:, col, 0] = 255 - (col * 255 // width)  # Red decreases
          image[:, col, 2] = col * 255 // width          # Blue increases
          # Green channel stays 0
      
      # Display
      plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
      plt.imshow(image)
      plt.axis('off')
      plt.title('Red to Blue Gradient')
      plt.show()
   
   **How it works:**
   
   * `col * 255 // width` calculates a proportion: when `col=0` (left edge), value is 0; when `col=width-1` (right edge), value is ~255
   * Red channel: `255 - proportion` starts at 255 (left) and decreases to 0 (right)
   * Blue channel: `proportion` starts at 0 (left) and increases to 255 (right)
   * The result is a smooth transition through purples in the middle where red and blue overlap
   
   **Challenge extension:** Try creating a **vertical** gradient, or a gradient from yellow to cyan!

Summary
=======

In just 15-20 minutes, you've learned the foundational concept of digital image representation:

**Key takeaways:**

* Digital images are NumPy arrays with shape `(height, width, 3)` for RGB
* Each pixel stores three intensity values from 0-255 (one per color channel)
* RGB uses **additive color mixing**: combine light to create colors
* Array indexing: `image[y, x, channel]` where y=row, x=column
* Equal RGB values create grayscale; different values create colors
* You can create images programmatically by setting array values

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**

* Don't confuse RGB (additive/light) with CMYK (subtractive/paint)
* Remember: `image[row, column]` not `image[x, y]`
* Always use `dtype=np.uint8` for standard 0-255 image data
* Different libraries may use BGR instead of RGB (looking at you, OpenCV!) 

This foundational knowledge prepares you for more advanced color manipulations, transformations, and eventually, generative AI art creation.
